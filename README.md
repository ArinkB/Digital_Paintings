# DIGITAL CHILDREN'S DRAWINGS / PAINTINGS
*Creating digital library of drawings/painting from 3 kids.* 

#### Arink Bertrand

I have piles of drawings and pictures from my kids that are just sitting in a box and collecting dust. What I'd like to do is create a digital library of their drawings and create a python program to randomly pick an image from the folder for each kid, no repeat. 
Eventually I would like to place a monitor with a frame on the wall and be able to view these as wall art in our home.

#### Steps 
[] Create Readme file to explain plan
[] Scan images from kids
[] Rename images to include kid name
[] Import necessary packages
[]
[] Update ReadMe to futher explain varifications, language etc.
#### Dependencies
[] Import Random
